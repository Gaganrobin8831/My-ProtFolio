            <p className='my-2 mx-auto w-[80%]'>I view software development through two lenses: the engineer and the instructor.

                My foundation is built on 1.5 years of teaching the MERN Stack still working as a teacher, where I broke down complex concepts for students daily. This experience didn't just teach me how to code—it taught me how to communicate technical ideas clearly and debug code efficiently.</p>

            <p className='my-2 mx-auto w-[80%]'>  I backed this theoretical mastery with practical application as a Backend Developer at Netweb Technology (Feb 2024 to Dec 2024), working on production-level architectures. Today, I combine these worlds to build robust React Native apps and Live MERN projects, ensuring every line of code serves a purpose.</p>
